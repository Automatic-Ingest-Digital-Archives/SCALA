# SCALA

SCALA is a joint project of nine heritage institutions in Flanders and Brussels (AIDA), who are jointly designing a system for the long-term preservation of born-digital archives with cultural-historical value. SCALA is conceived as a proof of concept to test a pilot version of a digital archive depot (digital repository). This digital repository stores archives in generic digital archive containers (information packages) according to the OAIS model and the new European standard E-ARK. It is open source and is being developed by a third party IT vendor.

SCALA is a pioneer in Flanders with the use of E-ARK and as a result organizes an E-ARK working group with external partners, with whom they want to arrive at a Flemish standard model for information packages. This model should promote sustainability, system independence and collaboration.

To get familiar with the pilot preservation system, please start by reading the SCALA Workflow. Then to start using the system, consult the SCALA IP Ingestion Manual.
