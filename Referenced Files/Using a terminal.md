# Using a terminal

Some tasks are best performed by running a script in a terminal. A terminal is a program where you can write
instructions for your computer to execute. Computers normally come with a terminal program installed by default. On
Windows the program is “PowerShell” and on Mac/Linux it is usually “Bash”. A terminal looks something like this:

There are always two tasks involved when using a terminal for a SCALA ingest task. (1) Open the terminal in the root
folder of your TS and (2) copy-paste the script in the terminal and press “Enter” to run it.
