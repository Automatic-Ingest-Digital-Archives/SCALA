# SCALA Workflow

Here you can find a description of the steps involved in the SCALA workflow. Following these steps allows you to transfer archival data into SIPs, then into AIPs and finally have them stored on disk for permanent storage.

## 1. Archival data to SIP

### 1.1. Extract archival data from your archive management system

|  |  |
|--|--|
| What | Get your archival data and export it to your computer. |
| How | Arrange your digital born files into comprehensive units of archival data (such as series/files/items/...). For each such unit, we will later on create a SIP. You can go as granular as you wish, and there can be parent-child relations between SIPs. Each unit of archival data must be exported into its own separate folder on your computer. |
| Where | Your archival data is probably in your company's archive management system. |

### 1.2. Extract descriptive metadata from your archive management system

|  |  |
|--|--|
| What | Prepare descriptive metadata for each SIP. |
| Why | Descriptive metadata will help make sure you can look up and retrieve the content of your SIPs in later stages. The more details given, the better. Examples of descriptive metadata fields are title, creator, producer, scope & content, release date, ... |
| How | From you archive management system, export descriptive metadata into an XML file per SIP. There are international standards with naming and structuring definitions for the fields in these XMLs. EAD 2002 and Dublin Core are famous examples you can adhere to. Otherwise simple key-value pairs work as well.</br></br> If there is no descriptive metadata available in your archive management system, you will have to type it yourself into an XML file per SIP (which can be a painful process). Or maybe there is an AI solution out there which can inspect your archival data and extract the metadata for you! |
| Where | Ideally you can export this data as an XML per SIP from your archive management system. Otherwise you will have to create the XMLs yourself. |

### 1.3. Create SIPs using RODA-In

|  |  |
|--|--|
| What | Create E-ARK2 SIPs by combining archival data and their respective descriptive metadata in structured way. |
| How | RODA-In is our recommended SIP creation tool. Use it to select your data folders and automatically match descriptive metadata. Then you can make representation edits and add extra documentation if needed. Lastly generate E-ARK2 structured SIPS, with METS file and representations.</br></br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87436774/161509331-adc80ea2-8ad4-48a5-a5b1-8633440db885.png) |
